# Trigger-Word-Detection-for-a-Laptop-using-Deep-Learning
In this notebook, we will construct a speech dataset and implement an algorithm for trigger word detection (sometimes also called keyword detection, or wakeword detection). Trigger word detection is the technology that allows devices like Amazon Alexa, Google Home, Apple Siri, and Baidu DuerOS to wake up upon hearing a certain word.  For this exercise, our trigger word will be "Activate." Every time it hears you say "activate," it will make a "chiming" sound. By the end of this assignment, you will be able to record a clip of yourself talking, and have the algorithm trigger a chime when it detects you saying "activate."
